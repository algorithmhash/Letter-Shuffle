# Letter-Shuffle
  <h3 class="shuffle"> Just a simple letter shuffle.</h3>
  
  <link type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery.shuffle.js"

In this jquery script, this allows you to scramble letters into a word that is pre stated in your javascript file. If you want to edit what kind of letters, or just numbers, just clone or download the file.

   
   Then add the class to a header tag like so:
   
   `<h1 class= "scramble">Scramble this</h1>`
or even a normal paragraph tag.
